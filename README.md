# Trusted Rust toolchain
This project collects Rust end-to-end development, build, check, and test tools through the open source community, and provides examples and scripts for the continuous integration platform, helping users quickly use Rust for development.
The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a complete trusted tool chain for the Rust project.

There is no doubt that the project is still in its very early stages and any questions, uses or contributions are very welcome.
