# 可信工具链
本项目目的是通过开源社区收集Rust端到端开发、构建、检查和测试等工具，并为持续集成平台提供运行示例和检查脚本，帮助用户快速使用rust开发。
本项目的最终目标是为Rust项目建立整套可信工具链。

毫无疑问，这个项目还处于非常早期的阶段，任何问题、使用或贡献都是非常受欢迎的。

# Trusted Rust toolchain
This project collects Rust end-to-end development, build, check, and test tools through the open source community, and provides examples and scripts for the continuous integration platform, helping users quickly use Rust for development.
The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a complete trusted tool chain for the Rust project.

There is no doubt that the project is still in its very early stages and any questions, uses or contributions are very welcome.
